<p><strong>The moderate climb to the firetower on Blue Mountain provides great views of the lake country to the southwest and the High Peaks to the northeast.</strong></p>

<p>The summit of Blue Mountain is 3765 feet above sea level, making it the 66th highest mountain in the Adirondacks. From a starting point at nearly 2200 feet the 2.1 mile route ascends 1600 feet. That would be 800 feet of ascent per mile if the ascent was steady. But it's not, the trail climbs at a gentle rate for the first three quarters of a mile. The grade then increases and finally climbs steeply for the last half mile.</p>
<p>Blue Mountain is not a big climb by High Peaks standards, but it's a big mountain for occasional hikers, and more than a few have been fooled by the ease of access. This is a mountain where a little preparation goes a long way and sturdy shoes, plenty of water, and persistence are needed to reach the top. Once you get there, the view is worth it. The view of Blue Mountain Lake is outstanding as is the view towards Tirrel Pond and with the High Peaks in the distance.</p>

<p>The elevation also means near the top you'll be in the sub-alpine ecological zone. The harsh conditions above 3000 feet result in a mix of trees that is not found at lower elevations. In the Adirondacks, Balsam Fir, Red and Black Spruce, and White Birch dominate this zone and you'll see plenty of them along this route.</p>
